# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project analyses a real-world hotel booking dataset to identify key factors that contribute to booking cancellations. Using Excel for data cleaning, exploration, and visualisations, the goal was to uncover actionable insights that could help hotel managers reduce cancellations and improve operational efficiency.

---

##  Objective

- Explore how customer, booking, and hotel-related factors influence the likelihood of a cancellation.
- Build a predictive model to estimate the probability of a booking being cancelled.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce cancellation rates.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Excel** – for data cleaning, feature creation, pivot tables, and charting
- *(Optional/Planned)*: Python or Power BI for future modeling or dashboarding

---

##  Project Structure
- Notebook/ # Jupyter notebook(s) containing the analysis or modelling steps
- Summary Report/ # Written report or PDF summarizing the key findings
- Visuals/ # Charts and visualizations created during the analysis
- data/ # Raw and cleaned dataset(s) used in the project
- README.md # Project overview and documentation


---

##  Key Insights

- **Booking lead time** is strongly associated with cancellations — longer lead times see higher cancellation rates.
- **Bookings with no deposit** were far more likely to be cancelled compared to those with a deposit.
- **Repeat guests** were significantly less likely to cancel.
- **Weekday vs weekend stays** and **market segment type** also played a role in cancellation patterns.

##  About the Dataset

The dataset contains information on over 30,000 hotel bookings from a city hotel and a resort hotel. Key variables include:
- Booking lead time
- Number of adults/children
- Type of meal plan
- Deposit type
- Customer type (new vs repeat)
- Booking source (online, corporate, etc.)
- Special requests
- Cancellation status

##  Reflections

This project helped deepen my understanding of how operational and customer variables influence cancellation behaviour. It also allowed me to practice using Excel not just for calculations, but for structuring an end-to-end analysis: from cleaning and filtering to insights and recommendations.

---

##  Future Work

- Train a classification model using Python (e.g., logistic regression or random forest)
- Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI or Tableau
- Explore the economic cost of cancellations and possible prevention strategies
